Write a Java program following these instructions:

Create an abstract class named Shape that declares an abstract method double
calculateArea()

Create two subclasses: Rectangle and Circle. Both should extend the Super class

In the Rectanglerclass, add two attributes: length and width. Provide a constructor to initialize them, and implement the calculateArea() method to return the area of the rectangle.

In the Circle class, add one attribute radius. Provide a constructor to initialize it, and implement the calculateArea() method to return the area of the circle.

In the main method, prompt the user to choose a shape (1 for rectangle, 2 for circle).

Based on the choice, ask the user to enter the necessary dimensions (length and width for rectangle, radius for circle).

Create an instance of the appropriate class and call its calculateArea() method.

Print the calculated area.
